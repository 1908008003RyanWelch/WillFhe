# WillFHE

**WillFHE** is a privacy-preserving, blockchain-based platform for creating, managing, and executing encrypted digital wills and testaments.  
By leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, it enables conditional execution of assets based on encrypted criteria, maintaining privacy while ensuring immutability and trustless operation.

## Project Overview

Estate planning and digital wills are critical tools for ensuring assets are distributed according to a user’s wishes.  
However, conventional approaches face significant challenges:

- **Privacy risks:** Digital or on-chain wills often expose sensitive personal and financial data  
- **Trust issues:** Executors or intermediaries may manipulate or delay distribution  
- **Complex conditions:** Execution depends on verification of external events, such as death or legal approval  

WillFHE solves these problems by providing a **secure, encrypted environment** for conditional execution using FHE, ensuring assets are allocated only when specific conditions are met without revealing the underlying details.

## Motivation

Traditional will execution systems can lead to:

- Unauthorized access to personal or financial information  
- Vulnerability to disputes over inheritance details  
- Complexity in verifying conditions like death, age, or other legal milestones  

WillFHE enables:

- Automated, condition-based execution  
- Fully encrypted asset allocation logic  
- Protection of sensitive estate data from third parties

## Core Features

### 🔹 Encrypted Digital Wills

- Users can create wills in encrypted form  
- Supports complex conditions such as multiple beneficiaries and staged distributions  
- Keeps all personal, financial, and legal data confidential

---

### 🔹 Conditional Execution via FHE

- FHE-based smart contracts evaluate encrypted execution conditions  
- Example: Oracle confirms death without revealing personal data  
- Ensures that only authorized conditions trigger asset distribution

---

### 🔹 Automatic Asset Distribution

- Once conditions are verified, assets are distributed automatically according to the encrypted plan  
- Reduces reliance on intermediaries and executors  
- Supports multiple asset types including cryptocurrencies and tokens

---

### 🔹 Immutable and Trustless Ledger

- Wills are recorded on-chain in encrypted form  
- Prevents tampering or modification  
- Blockchain guarantees auditable, transparent execution without exposing sensitive details
